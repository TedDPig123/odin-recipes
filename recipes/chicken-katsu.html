This recipe can also be used to make tonkatsu 
by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve 
with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.

dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; 
dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated 
on both sides.
